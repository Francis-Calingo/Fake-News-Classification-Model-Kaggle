## Binary Classification Introduction
<p>Classification is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that attempts to correctly assign a label given an input. For example, in image classification, the machine learning model attempts to 
label an image, such as whether the image input is that of a dog or a cat. What was just described is a classic example of binary classification, where the machine predicts whether the input belongs in one category or the other (i.e., one of possible two). Determining whether an article can be classified as fake news or not, as this project aims to do, is another example of binary classification.</p>
